Grading System
📝 Description

This Python script takes a student's marks as input and prints the corresponding grade based on predefined grade ranges.

⚙️ How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter their marks (integer value).

It then compares the entered marks against several conditions.

Based on the marks, it prints the appropriate grade.

🧮 Grading Criteria
Marks Range	Grade
90 and above	A+
80 - 89	A
75 - 79	B+
70 - 74	B
50 - 69	C
34 - 49	D
Below 34	Fail
💻 Example Run
Enter marks: 82
grade = A

🚀 How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

Save the script as Grading system.py.

Run it in a terminal or IDE:

python "Grading system.py"

🧠 Notes

The program assumes valid integer input.

You can modify the grade boundaries easily by editing the conditional statements.
